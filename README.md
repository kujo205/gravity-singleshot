# Gravity Singleshot design doc

# **Context**

**Gravity Singleshot** \- a mini game, designed around properties of gravity in space. You begin your journey as a tiny, yet ambitious comet.

You wanna reach the Earth and destroy the planet, but unfortunately, there are a bunch of other objects on your way. Your task is to come up with the best trajectory to bypass those objects and destroy the planet.

Game consists of a bunch of rounds, each rounds has a unique assembly of planets with some custom orbit properties.

You set the trajectory of the comet, launch it and see whether it reaches the earth.  
There are also **diamonds** on the map you can collect and later on exchange for some custom skins.

Some rounds will also have checkpoints in the middle of the round. Some rounds can have gravitational fields obstructing the movement of the comet. Those fields have to be disabled somehow
